README

In this repository I am placing a clean and reduced version of some of the codes that I implemented
for my project on Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis for the company 'Just Eat'.
In the folder of presentations you can find a 5 minutes 'pitch' of the project aimed to a wider audience.
These and other notebooks can be seen in a readable (and ducumented) form in the following links:

Note: A large part of the exploratory analysis  and a portions of the validation are not included because they contain sensitive information for the company.
A reduced functional form of the trained model was delivered to the companny for immediate use.
